# EDA_Project_Wine_Quality

In this project, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) exercise of wines and their quality was applied.

Data: Wine Quality Data Set from the Machine Learning Repository of UCI. 🧮

Objective: to understand if some of the characteristics of wines affect their quality. For example, to see if by increasing or decreasing the chemical substances that compose it, the quality increases or decreases. With this, producers could modify the manufacturing process to aim for higher quality. 🍷

Tools: Google Colab & Python (Data Analysis libraries). 🪐🐍
